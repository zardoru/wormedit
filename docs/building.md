# Building wormedit

The stage-zero build separates the headless core/tests from the existing SDL/OpenGL application scaffold. SDL3 GPU migration and production dependency packaging follow in later milestones.

## Native headless build

nlohmann/json, Catch2, and Lua accept local source directories for offline/reproducible builds:

```sh
cmake --preset headless \
  -DWORMEDIT_NLOHMANN_JSON_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/nlohmann-json-3.12.0 \
  -DWORMEDIT_CATCH2_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/Catch2 \
  -DWORMEDIT_LUA_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/lua-5.4.8
cmake --build --preset headless
ctest --preset headless
```

Omit the source-directory options when network-backed FetchContent is acceptable. nlohmann/json is pinned to the v3.12.0 release archive and SHA-256, uses its MIT license, and is built with diagnostic byte positions enabled. Catch2 is pinned to commit `2b60af89e23d28eefc081bc930831ee9d45ea58b` (v3.8.1 source), and Lua is pinned to `6e22fedb74cf0c9b6656e9fce8b7331db847c605` (Lua 5.4.8 source).

## UI frontend selection

Application builds select exactly one frontend with
`-DWORMEDIT_UI_BACKEND=nuklear|imgui|clay`. The initial Nuklear adapter is the
only implemented choice, so application configuration rejects `imgui` and
`clay` with a clear diagnostic until those adapters exist. Headless builds may
select any declared value without fetching or linking a UI dependency. An
unknown value always fails configuration. The executable links the selected
adapter through the private `wormedit::ui_frontend` target; `wormedit_core`
remains UI-library-free.

## Crash backtraces on Linux and macOS

The application installs fatal-signal and C++ termination handlers before SDL
initialization. Run a Debug build from a terminal to retain file and line
information in the executable and see the backtrace on standard error after
`SIGABRT`, `SIGSEGV`, `SIGILL`, `SIGFPE`, or `SIGBUS`. An unhandled C++ exception
also prints its message. The handler restores the signal's default termination
behavior, so the operating system's core-dump policy still applies. Stack
unwinding after severe memory corruption is best effort.

On Linux, an executable `+0x...` offset in the output can be resolved with
`addr2line -C -f -e build/wormedit 0x...`. On macOS, keep the matching
executable and dSYM to symbolize a crash with `atos` or `lldb`.

## Cross-compiling the headless core for Linux

The generic toolchain does not assume GCC versus Clang or a particular SDK. Set at least the two compiler paths:

```sh
export WORMEDIT_LINUX_C_COMPILER=/path/to/linux-cc
export WORMEDIT_LINUX_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/linux-c++
export WORMEDIT_LINUX_SYSROOT=/path/to/linux-sysroot
export WORMEDIT_LINUX_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

cmake --preset linux-cross-headless \
  -DWORMEDIT_NLOHMANN_JSON_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/nlohmann-json-3.12.0 \
  -DWORMEDIT_CATCH2_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/Catch2 \
  -DWORMEDIT_LUA_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/lua-5.4.8
cmake --build --preset linux-cross-headless
```

`WORMEDIT_LINUX_SYSROOT` and `WORMEDIT_LINUX_TARGET` are optional when the compiler already encodes them. To execute discovered tests on the build host, set `WORMEDIT_CROSS_EMULATOR` to a compatible emulator before configuration. Otherwise copy the build tree/test executables to the Linux target and run CTest there; compilation remains a useful cross-build gate but is not reported as a runtime pass.

The full application cross-build will receive a separate preset after SDL3 GPU, audio decoder, and packaging dependencies have target-side discovery rules. This avoids accidentally linking host libraries into a Linux artifact.

## Cross-compiling the headless core for Windows from Linux

The Windows toolchain is likewise compiler-agnostic and works with a MinGW-w64 GCC toolchain or a suitably configured Clang toolchain:

```sh
export WORMEDIT_WINDOWS_C_COMPILER=/path/to/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
export WORMEDIT_WINDOWS_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
export WORMEDIT_WINDOWS_RC_COMPILER=/path/to/x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres
export WORMEDIT_WINDOWS_TARGET=x86_64-w64-windows-gnu

cmake --preset windows-cross-headless \
  -DWORMEDIT_NLOHMANN_JSON_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/nlohmann-json-3.12.0 \
  -DWORMEDIT_CATCH2_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/Catch2 \
  -DWORMEDIT_LUA_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/lua-5.4.8
cmake --build --preset windows-cross-headless
```

`WORMEDIT_WINDOWS_RC_COMPILER`, `WORMEDIT_WINDOWS_SYSROOT`, and `WORMEDIT_WINDOWS_TARGET` are optional when the compiler prefix already supplies them. Set `WORMEDIT_CROSS_EMULATOR` to a Wine executable if the build host can run the generated test programs; otherwise execute CTest on Windows and treat the Linux job as a compile gate.

As with Linux cross-builds, enable the full application only after its Windows-target SDL3 GPU, decoder, and packaging dependencies are supplied as target packages/source builds. Host package discovery must never satisfy a Windows dependency.
